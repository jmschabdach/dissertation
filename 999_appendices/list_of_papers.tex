\chapter{Potential Publication Topics}

\begin{itemize}
\item DAG-based Volume Registration for Recovering Neonatal rs-fMRIs:  present DAG-based volume registration in the context of a small, healthy cohort; feasibility study. \textbf{\textit{Note: paper being revised for resubmission to JAMIA.}}

\item DAG-based Volume Registration in a Comprehensive Motion Correction Pipeline for CHD and Healthy Patients: generalize the results of the previous paper to more age groups, motion types, and clinical outcomes.

\item Does Motion Correction Recover Signal: Discuss the simulated phantom images and how both registration methods and the motion correction pipeline affect them.

\item Analysis of Human Phantom rs-fMRIs for a Multicenter Neuroimaging Study

\item Patterns of Motion Across Life: describe the different motion patterns seen in different age groups; propose a formal scale of motion in terms of frequency, severity, and entropy.

\item  Relationships between motion metrics and clinical, behavioral, and demographic data among different CHD and healthy patient populations.
\end{itemize}

Other publications could be any combination of age groups, clinical status, and neurological conditions at different stages of analysis pipeline including volume registration, motion correction, and functional connectivity analysis.
