\section{CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS}

Congenital heart defects and congenital heart disease (CHD) both refer to defects in the heart or the vessels around the heart which formed during  fetal development. Heart defects affect how blood moves into, through, and away from the heart. 
CHD can affect any combination of heart chambers and blood vessels with varying degrees of severity. The lesions prevent the cardiopulmonary system as a whole from functioning correctly, but pinpointing and treating the defects effectively can be a complex process.
 
% Causes of CHD: genetic syndromes, single gene mutations, environmental exposure, and unknown
There are a number of genetic and environmental factors associated with different presentations of CHD \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Noonan syndrome are associated with different CHD presentations. Maternal behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking are known to cause heart problems in the fetus. Other maternal risk factors are obesity, folate deficiency, and living at a high altitude. Paternal exposure to phthalates, anesthesia, sympathomimetic medications, pesticides, and solvents may increase the risk of the fetus for developing CHD. While there are quite a few factors in this list, there are many CHD cases whose causes are unknown.

% Diagnosis
The process of diagnosing CHD can begin before birth. A specialized ultrasound test called fetal echocardiography can detect heart abnormalities as early as the second trimester of the pregnancy. Additional tests, such as amniocentesis and follow-up ultrasounds may be needed to determine treatment options. Generally, severe CHD cases present and are detected at earlier stages, but minor defects may not become apparent until the patient is older. 

The incidence of CHD in live births vary across countries and continents. The United States reports approximately 4-10 CHD case per 1,000 live births. Europe and Asia see about 6.9 and 9.3 CHD cases per 1,000 live births \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. 
In China, the incidence of CHD ranges from 8.98 to 11.1 per 1,000 live births \cite{Zhao2019} \cite{Qu2016}. 
A pair of studies from Iran report incidences of 8.6 and 12.3 per 1,000 live births, and the studies note that they were performed in different geographical locations with different populations within the country \cite{Nikyar2011} \cite{Rahim2008}.
One report from Dharan reports an incidence of 5.8 per 1,000 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a 12 month period \cite{Shah2008}. A study of newborns at one hospital in New Delhi, India claims an incidence of 3.9 per 1,000 live births, though this rate may be a poor estimate as there is a significant delay between patient birth and referral to a cardiac center in India \cite{Khalil1994} \cite{Saxena2005}.

These incidence rates should be analyzed with some caution. In many cases, the reported rates were based on medical records. Medical records are not always correct. Additionally, the only way for a person to have a correct medical record is for him to go to a medical center. Not everyone who has CHD is able to seek medical help, often because of their geographical locations or their income. Even if a patient is able to seek medical help, the availability of proper cardiac care varies between and within countries. 

As screening tools become more effective and more widespread, it is expected that incidence rates will increase as defects are detected earlier. Generally, the earlier a defect is detected, the earlier it can be treated. Early detection and treatment means more CHD patients will live to adulthood. Currently, Webb et al. estimate that at least 12 to 34 million adults have CHD, and this number is expected to increase \cite{Webb2015}.

A breakdown of prevalence rates of some of the most common lesion types can be seen in Table \ref{ch2:fig:usa-defects-prev}.

Once a patient is diagnosed with one of these defects, the specific nature of his case must be clearly documented. The documentation of CHD using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) has 25 high level codes representing various presentations of CHD, but these codes used on their own are often not sufficient for describing a patient's true condition \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Additional ICD-9-CM codes should be used to communicate the finer details of a patient's condition.

%Depending on the cause of the 
The financial burden of CHD varies depending on the defect. Certain defects require complex, expensive surgical repairs while others can be treated with less expensive approaches \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. The burden of CHD across the globe was outlined by Webb et al. Their figure illustrating the prevalence of CHD and the availability of funds with which to treat it can be see in Figure \ref{ch2:fig:CHD-burden}. As the overall mortality of CHD declines, the burden of CHD is expected to increase \cite{Mozaffarian2016}.

% Complications and risks
Unfortunately, the cost of treating CHD alone is not the only burden a patient must undergo. Patients with CHD are also at increased risk for heart failure and infections \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Children with CHD are at 19-fold risk for stroke compared to their healthy counterparts \cite{Fox2015}. Giang et al performed a study comparing the prevalence of cardiac conditions in patients with and without CHD born between 1970 and 1993 in Sweden. They found that patients who had a CHD diagnosis were at about eight times higher risk for intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage than their non-CHD counterparts. The CHD patients were also more likely to suffer from arrhythmia and heart failure.

\section{CHD AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS}

Cardiac conditions are not the only complications CHD must deal with. Recently, researchers have found that there is a relationship between CHD and neurocognitive disorders. 

%\subsection{Causes}

Early research in this area focuses on the neurodevelopmental status of neonatal patients pre- and post-surgical intervention. One theory was that some factor or factors in the surgical intervention caused brain injuries in the patients. This idea proved to be inaccurate when researchers began detecting neurological malformations in utero.

In a systematic review of available literature regarding prenatal and postnatal presurgical CHD cases and neurodevelopmental outcomes, Mebius et al. identify two theories about the causality of  neurodevelopmental delays and CHD \cite{Mebius2017}. The first theory is that abnormalities in the cardiac system prevent the developing brain from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients, which disrupts prenatal brain development. The second theory is that faulty genetic pathways used during both cardiac and brain development cause both conditions to co-occur. 

However, a third theory has begun to emerge. Since the combination of CHD and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes can be traced back to prenatal development, researchers investigated other factors related to prenatal brain oxygenation. During the prenatal period, a fetus receives oxygen from the mother via the placenta. Mebius et al. found 11 articles related to bloodflow through the umbilical artery. Though these articles have contradictory results, the role of the placenta in CHD and brain development cannot yet be discounted.

%\subsection{Common Disorder Combinations}

%\subsection{Aging}

Survival of CHD patients to adulthood has increased from 10\% to 90\% over the last several decades. The impact of the combination of CHD and neurological conditions is being explored. The aging of the CHD population has also sparked interest in the relationships between CHD and adult-stage neurological disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's.

\subsection{NEUROLOGICAL IMAGES}

When an area of the brain is active, it uses more oxygen than the surrounding regions. Combinations of brain regions which are active at the same time are called neuronal networks. The idea of a neuronal network which operated when a person is at rest was proposed in 2001, and then confirmed in 2003 \cite{Raichle2001} \cite{Greicius2003}. Resting-state networks are recorded using resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRIs). rs-fMRIs are sequences of image volumes acquired over a period of a few minutes while the patient is in a task-free state. The image volumes themselves have relatively low spatial resolution when compared to structural MRIs, but their temporal resolution is significantly higher as a new volume is acquired every two to three seconds. Each volume records the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals within the brain at that point in time. 

The BOLD signals in rs-fMRI image sequences are analyzed using a process called functional connectivity analysis. Functional connectivity analysis identifies patterns and networks of brain activity. Because the patient is not performing a specific task during a rs-fMRI acquisition, these resting-state networks have the potential to reveal valuable information about a patient's neurodevelopmental status. Some functional connectivity analysis studies have lead to the discoveries of links between specific disruptions in these naturally occurring networks and neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \cite{Assaf2010} \cite{Zang2007}. With further refinements of both acquisition techniques and characterization of these functional networks, clinicians may be able to use rs-fMRI to evaluate the neurodevelopmental status of CHD patients and to identify patients who may benefit from certain therapies or neuroprotective interventions.

The next chapter will address the challenges of using rs-fMRIs as a tool for diagnosing CHD.
