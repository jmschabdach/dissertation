\section{Original Intro}

Patient motion is a critical cause of data loss in medical imaging. Many approaches have been developed to prevent and reduce the impact of motion before, during, and after image acquisition. The effectiveness of these techniques vary between patient populations. If the effects of a patient's movements cannot be removed from an image, that image is considered to have been corrupted by motion and is deemed unusable.

Various clinical, behavioral, and technical protocols have been developed in an attempt to prevent patient motion from impacting the rs-fMR image as it is acquired. Sedation can be used to immobilize a patient during a scan, but requires additional personal to perform safely and involves a greater time commitment from the patient. Sedation is also not recommended for use in young children and fetal patients. Behavioral and educational techniques can be employed to prepare a patient for stressors he may experience during a medical imaging scan, but these approaches do not prevent the patient from moving out of boredom, discomfort, or distress. Several groups have developed techniques to compensate for motion as an image is acquired, but these techniques often require additional scanner-compatible equipment and can only be utilized during the scan. Additional processing is needed to remove motion from an image after the scan is acquired.

Though patient motion is a problem across the entire medical imaging domain, we focus specifically on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). rs-fMRIs measure the blood oxygen level dependent signal in an organ or organ system. Areas of an organ with greater activity require more oxygen than less active areas. When used to examine the brain, the signals recorded by the rs-fMRI are used as an effective approximation of the amount of activity occurring in different areas of the brain. The term ``resting state'' means that the patient is not performing any particular task, so any activity that occurs is from underlying networks connecting different areas of the brain. 

To gather enough data to fully evaluate these networks, a series of image volumes must be acquired over a period of several minutes. In a standard rs-fMRI, one new image volume is obtained approximately once every two to three seconds. To gather high quality data on such a short timescale, the rs-fMRI suffers from two major limitations: rs-fMR images have low physical resolution and are highly susceptible to motion. The first limitation can be addressed by obtaining an MR image with high physical resolution and registering the rs-fMRI to this structural image, but the second limitation is a significant problem. Patients undergoing a rs-fMRI scan are instructed to remain as still as possible for the entire duration of the scan, but this task is particularly difficult for populations of certain ages as well as populations who suffer from neurocognitive disorders. As a result, many rs-fMRI studies struggle to obtain enough low-motion scans to come to statistically significant conclusions. Although rs-fMRIs have great promise in the clinical domain, their usage is limited until the problem of patient motion is resolved.

As discussed above, behavioral and educational techniques have been developed to help the patient remain calm before and during the scan but do not prevent the patient from moving during the scan. Sedation or intra-scan motion monitoring approaches are difficult to integrate with MR scanners due to the constraints of MR safety requirements. Many methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of motion after the rs-fMRI is acquired. While different post-acquisition motion correction pipelines utilize different processing techniques, they begin with global volume registration. Global volume registration is the process used to align all volumes in a rs-fMRI sequence into the same physical space. Traditionally, all volumes in the sequence are registered directly to one volume. This approach can be effective in images where the subject remains relatively still throughout the duration of the scan, but is not as successful in images containing high quantities of patient movement.

We have developed an alternative volume registration framework which takes into account the spatiotemporal relationships between sequential volumes in the rs-fMRI sequence and uses these relationships during the registration process. Herein, we evaluate it further in the context of a complete motion correction pipeline across healthy and disease populations at various stages of life. In addition to reducing the effects of patient motion on image quality, we are also interested in the patient motion itself. We believe there are relationships between different motion patterns, patient age, and clinical outcomes, and we have explored these relationships throughout our experiments.

%While correcting motion within an rs-fMRI is important both for clinical use and research applications, we are also interested in the motion itself. In addition to evaluating a global volume registration framework in the context of a fully motion correction pipeline, we also investigate the relationships between a patient's motion and their clinical outcomes, specifically to further the study of CHD and neurological disorders across the lifetime of the patient. %This analysis is valuable for each of our subject populations for different reasons. For the preadolescent patients, we are investigating the relationship between in-scan motion, neurocognitive development, and congenital heart disease status. In the fetal images, we investigate the relationship between FETAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND PLACENTAL GROWTH. % need to run this part by Ashok.
%These investigations use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine what relationships a computer can detect between these pieces of information.


%The study of these networks is called functional connectivity analysis, and it is an invaluable tool for evaluating a patient's neurodevelopmental status. 

%The lack of consistent results across motion correction techniques is a major problem when performing an imaging study on a large patient cohort.

The disease population we used for our study is a population with a variety of congenital heart defects. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) have many presentations, and all cause problems in a patient's heart structure and the structure of the surrounding vessels. It has been found that the development of cardiac problems \textit{in utero} is often linked to delays in patient neurodevelopment. Research in the area of CHD and neurodevelopment has often focused on younger populations. However, treatment of CHDs has evolved over the past fifty years with the result that many CHD patients live to adulthood: every year, approximately 1.35 million children are born with a congenital heart defect and it is currently estimated that about 12 to 34 million adults are living with CHD \cite{VanderLinde2011}. Researchers have recognized the burden of neurocognitive disorders on the aging CHD population and are now starting to investigate the relationships between CHD and neurocognitive outcomes.

The process for objectively identifying neurocognitive disorders is still under development. Psychologists have developed and validated surveys to estimate a patient's neurocognitive status. These surveys vary with the child's. Initially, a parent fills out the survey on behalf of his infant or toddler child. When the child has reached certain developmental milestones, the parent and child might both fill out different portions of a different survey. At some point, the child can fill out his own survey. Psychologists may meet with the patient and his parents to determine a diagnosis. These survey based methods are highly subjective, and objective methods based on rs-fMRIs are being explored. 

Eventually, clinicians will be able to develop a lifespan approach to managing CHD and neurocognitive disorders. As a community, we are still in the data-gathering stage of this research. We cannot afford to lose rs-fMRI scans of healthy or CHD patients in any stage of life because of motion. For these reasons, a cohort of healthy and CHD patient images are an ideal data set for our motion correction work. 

%For our study, we will use our large set of neurological rs-fMRIs of both healthy  and CHD neonatal, preadolescent, and adult subjects. We also have a set of neurological and placental rs-fMRIs for healthy and CHD fetal patients. We will apply both the tradition and novel registration frameworks to all images in our different cohorts and evaluate the impact of each framework on each image after passing it through a complete motion correction pipeline. The original, registered, and motion corrected images will be used to address the aims discussed in this chapter.

%Our aims for this project are as follows:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Aim 1.} Evaluate the impact of global volume registration on simulated and clinical data within a complete motion correction pipeline.
%\item \textbf{Aim 2.} Study the motion patterns in the different populations to formally describe demographic related motion patterns.
%\item \textbf{Aim 3.} Employ machine learning techniques to (a) measure the impact of motion on image harmonization in multi-center studies, and (b) evaluate the relationship between motion and cognitive, clinical, and behavioral outcomes of CHD patients.

\section{Neurological Images}

When an area of the brain is active, it uses more oxygen than the surrounding regions. Functional MRIs (fMRI) are sensitive to signals emitted by deoxygenated hemoglobin. The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded by the fMRI reveal regions of the brain which are active at the same time. These combinations of regions are called neuronal networks. 

Many neuronal networks exist, but most of them are considered to be task related. In 2001, Raichle et al. suggested the existence of a neuronal network which operated when a person is at rest \cite{Raichle2001}. Their theory was confirmed by Greicius et al. in 2003 \cite{Greicius2003}. Because the patient is not performing a specific task when they are in a resting state, the resting-state networks have the potential to reveal valuable information about a patient's neurodevelopmental status.

A fMRI taken of a patient in a resting, task-free state, is called a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). rs-fMRIs are sequences of image volumes acquired over a period of a few minutes. The image volumes themselves have relatively low spatial resolution when compared to structural MRIs, but their temporal resolution is significantly higher as a new volume is acquired every two to three seconds. 

The BOLD signals in rs-fMRI image sequences are analyzed using a process called functional connectivity analysis. Functional connectivity analysis identifies patterns and networks of brain activity. Some functional connectivity analysis studies have lead to the discoveries of links between specific disruptions in these naturally occurring networks and neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \cite{Assaf2010} \cite{Zang2007}. With further refinements of both acquisition techniques and characterization of these functional networks, clinicians may be able to use rs-fMRI to evaluate the neurodevelopmental status of CHD patients and to identify patients who may benefit from certain therapies or neuroprotective interventions.
