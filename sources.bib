abstract = {OBJECTIVE Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital anomaly in newborns. The aim of this longitudinal, hospital-based study was to evaluate the prevalence and pattern of CHD among Iranian newborns in Gorgan, Northern Iran. METHODS 11739 live births in Dezyani hospital in Gorgan were screened for CHD, 2007 through 2008. Clinical examination, echocardiography, color Doppler and cardio catheterization were used as diagnostic tools. Clinical and demographic factors, namely sex, type of CHD and associated anomalies of diagnosed cases were recorded in a pre-designed questionnaire for analysis. FINDINGS The overall prevalence rate of CHD was 8.6 per 1000 live births. This was 9.96 per 1000 male births and 7.34 per 1000 female births. It was 4.5 and 13.19 per 1000 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. ASD was the commonest lesion (2.64 per 1000), followed by VSD+ASD (1.28 per 1000) and PDA (1.28 per 1000). The rate of ASD in male and female was 3.02 and 2.26 per 1000 respectively. Parents of 40 (39.6{\%}) babies were related. 39 (38.6{\%}) couples were first cousins. CONCLUSION This study showed that the prevalence of CHD among live births in Gorgan is lower than reported in the studies for Middle East and European countries.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The relationship of prenatal diagnosis of critical congenital heart disease (CHD) with brain injury and brain development is unknown. Given limited improvement of CHD outcomes with prenatal diagnosis, the effect of prenatal diagnosis on brain health may reveal additional benefits. OBJECTIVE To compare the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative brain injury and the trajectory of brain development in neonates with prenatal vs postnatal diagnosis of CHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study of term newborns with critical CHD recruited consecutively from 2001 to 2013 at the University of California, San Francisco and the University of British Columbia. Term newborns with critical CHD were studied with brain magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively and postoperatively to determine brain injury severity and microstructural brain development with diffusion tensor imaging by measuring fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient. Comparisons of magnetic resonance imaging findings and clinical variables were made between prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of critical CHD. A total of 153 patients with transposition of the great arteries and single ventricle physiology were included in this analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The presence of brain injury on the preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging and the trajectory of postnatal brain microstructural development. RESULTS Among 153 patients (67{\%}male), 96 had transposition of the great arteries and 57 had single ventricle physiology. The presence of brain injury was significantly higher in patients with postnatal diagnosis of critical CHD (41 of 86 [48{\%}]) than in those with prenatal diagnosis (16 of 67 [24{\%}]) (P = .003). Patients with prenatal diagnosis demonstrated faster brain development in white matter fractional anisotropy (rate of increase, 2.2{\%}; 95{\%}CI, 0.1{\%}-4.2{\%}; P = .04) and gray matter apparent diffusion coefficient (rate of decrease, 0.6{\%}; 95{\%}CI, 0.1{\%}-1.2{\%}; P = .02). Patients with prenatal diagnosis had lower birth weight (mean, 3184.5 g; 95{\%}CI, 3050.3-3318.6) than those with postnatal diagnosis (mean, 3397.6 g; 95{\%}CI, 3277.6-3517.6) (P = .02). Those with prenatal diagnosis had an earlier estimated gestational age at delivery (mean, 38.6 weeks; 95{\%}CI, 38.2-38.9) than those with postnatal diagnosis (mean, 39.1 weeks; 95{\%}CI, 38.8-39.5) (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Newborns with prenatal diagnosis of single ventricle physiology and transposition of the great arteries demonstrate less preoperative brain injury and more robust microstructural brain development than those with postnatal diagnosis. These results are likely secondary to improved cardiovascular stability. The impact of these findings on neurodevelopmental outcomes warrants further study.},

@article{Marelli2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Heart Association, Inc. The number of patients surviving with congenital heart disease (CHD) has soared over the last 3 decades. Adults constitute the fastest-growing segment of the CHD population, now outnumbering children. Research to date on the heart-brain intersection in this population has been focused largely on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Mutations in genes that are highly expressed in heart and brain may cause cerebral dysgenesis. Together with altered cerebral perfusion in utero, these factors are associated with abnormalities of brain structure and brain immaturity in a significant portion of neonates with critical CHD even before they undergo cardiac surgery. In infancy and childhood, the brain may be affected by risk factors related to heart disease itself or to its interventional treatments. As children with CHD become adults, they increasingly develop heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary disease. These acquired cardiovascular comorbidities can be expected to have effects similar to those in the general population on cerebral blood flow, brain volumes, and dementia. In both children and adults, cardiovascular disease may have adverse effects on achievement, executive function, memory, language, social interactions, and quality of life. Against the backdrop of shifting demographics, risk factors for brain injury in the CHD population are cumulative and synergistic. As neurodevelopmental sequelae in children with CHD evolve to cognitive decline or dementia during adulthood, a growing population of CHD can be expected to require support services. We highlight evidence gaps and future research directions.},

abstract = {Background Brain injury is a fundamental problem in infants with severe congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing neonatal cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). An impaired neuromotor and neurocognitive development is encountered and associated with a reduction in quality of life. New neuroprotective drugs during surgery are described to reduce brain injury and improve neurodevelopmental outcome (NDO). Therefore, our aim was to provide a systematic review and best-evidence synthesis on the effects of neuroprotective drugs on brain injury and NDO in CHD infants requiring cardiac surgery with CPB. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library (PRISMA statement). Search terms were ‘infants', ‘CHD', ‘cardiac surgery', ‘CPB' and ‘neuroprotective drug'. Data describing the effects on brain injury and NDO were extracted. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Two reviewers independently screened sources, extracted data and scored bias. Disagreements were resolved by involving a third researcher. Results The search identified 293 studies of which 6 were included. In total 527 patients with various CHD participated with an average of 88 infants (13-318) per study. Allopurinol, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), erythropoietin (EPO), ketamine, dextromethorphan and phentolamine were administered around cardiac surgery with CPB. Allopurinol showed less seizures, coma, death and cardiac events in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) infants (OR:0.44;95{\%}-CI:0.21-0.91). SNP resulted in lower post CPB levels of S100{\ss} in infants with transposition of the great arteries after 24 (p{\textless}0.01) and 48 hours (p=0.04) of treatment. EPO, ketamine and dextromethorphan showed no neuroprotective effects. Phentolamine led to higher S100{\ss}-levels and cerebrovascular resistance after rewarming and at the end of surgery (both p{\textless}0.01). Risk of bias varied between studies, including low (SNP, phentolamine), moderate (ketamine, dextromethorphan) and high (EPO, allopurinol) quality. Conclusions Allopurinol seems most promising for future trials in CHD infants to reduce brain injury given the early neuroprotective effects in HLHS infants. Larger well-designed trials are needed to assess the neuroprotective effects of SNP, EPO, ketamine and dextromethorphan. Future neuroprotective studies in CHD infants should not only focus on the perioperative period, however also on the perinatal period, since brain injury already exists preoperatively.},

abstract = {Congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for nearly one-third of all major congenital anomalies. CHD birth prevalence worldwide and over time is suggested to vary; however, a complete overview is missing. This systematic review included 114 papers, comprising a total study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHD identified in 164,396 individuals. Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 most common subtypes were pooled in 5-year time periods since 1930 and in continent and income groups since 1970 using the inverse variance method. Reported total CHD birth prevalence increased substantially over time, from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.4 to 0.8) in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95{\%} CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. Over the last 15 years, stabilization occurred, corresponding to 1.35 million newborns with CHD every year. Significant geographical differences were found. Asia reported the highest CHD birth prevalence, with 9.3 per 1,000 live births (95{\%} CI: 8.9 to 9.7), with relatively more pulmonary outflow obstructions and fewer left ventricular outflow tract obstructions. Reported total CHD birth prevalence in Europe was significantly higher than in North America (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95{\%} CI: 8.1 to 8.3] vs. 6.9 per 1,000 live births [95{\%} CI: 6.7 to 7.1]; p {\textless} 0.001). Access to health care is still limited in many parts of the world, as are diagnostic facilities, probably accounting for differences in reported birth prevalence between high- and low-income countries. Observed differences may also be of genetic, environmental, socioeconomical, or ethnic origin, and there needs to be further investigation to tailor the management of this global health problem. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

More and more, the question asked by clinicians is how much and where, rather than a simple statement on the presence or absence of abnormalities. The authors present a study in which the results obtained with a semiautomatic, multispectral segmentation technique are quantitatively compared to manually delineated regions. The core of the semiautomatic image analysis system is a supervised artificial neural network classifier augmented with dedicated preand postprocessing algorithms, including anisotropic noise filtering and a surface-fitting method for the correction of spatial intensity variations. The study was focused on the quantitation of white matter lesions in the human brain. A total of 36 images from six brain volumes was analyzed twice by each of two operators, under supervision of a neuroradiologist. Both the intra- and interrater variability of the methods were studied in terms of the average tissue area detected per slice, the correlation coefficients between area measurements, and a measure of similarity derived from the kappa statistic. The results indicate that, compared to a manual method, the use of the semiautomatic technique not only facilitates the analysis of the images, but also has similar or lower intra- and interrater variabilities.},

We have previously observed that these changes in patient position and rectal filling produce a shape change in the prostate. The registration of 1.5 T preoperative images depicting the prostate substructure [namely central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ)] to 0.5 T intraoperative MR images using this method can facilitate the segmentation of the substructure of the gland for radiation treatment planning. After creating and validating a dataset of manually segmented glands from images obtained in ten sequential MR-guided brachytherapy cases, we conducted a set of experiments to assess our hypothesis that the proposed registration system can significantly improve the quality of matching of the total gland (TG), CG, and PZ. The results showed that the method statistically-significantly improves the quality of match (compared to rigid registration), raising the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) from prematched coefficients of 0.81, 0.78, and 0.59 for TG, CG, and PZ, respectively, to 0.94, 0.86, and 0.76. A point-based measure of registration agreement was also improved by the deformable registration. CG and PZ volumes are not changed by the registration, indicating that the method maintains the biomechanical topology of the prostate. Although this strategy was tested for MRI-guided brachytherapy, the preliminary results from these experiments suggest that it may be applied to other settings such as transrectal ultrasound-guided therapy, where the integration of preoperative MRI may have a significant impact upon treatment planning and guidance.},

abstract = {A striking feature of the studies that have addressed the measurement of the amygdala is the wide range of volumes encountered, with reports of volumes ranging from 1 to almost 4cm3. Another striking feature is the number of discrepancies in the landmarks adopted for manual tracing in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal of our study was to assess the anatomical volume of the amygdala on the basis of its cytoarchitecture while comparing the differences in age and sex. This study was performed on 21 normal male brains (mean age of 56.8years) and 9 normal female brains (mean age of 61.2years). The volume of the amygdala was measured by planimetry of Nissl-stained serial sections using ImageJ software. To address the complexity of the amygdala, we elected to use two types of amygdalar measurement that differ mainly in the definition of anterior pole boundaries. The average size of the classic amygdala was 1.24cm3 (S.D.=0.14), while the average size of the amygdala with wider borders was 1.63cm3 (S.D.=0.2). No interhemispheric or intersexual differences were observed for either type of amygdalar measurement. Neither sex revealed any statistically important relationship between volume of the amygdala and age. Our study was concerned exclusively with the anatomical volume of the amygdala rather than the MRI volume. Nevertheless, our results may have important implications for MRI studies because as of yet there is no gold standard for manual volumetry of the amygdala. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Children with CHD at 19-fold risk for stroke (216)

ICD-9 has 25 CHD codes, but many more lesions exist that are not well defined by the ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes due to the large variance in CHD presentations/physiology

Incidence in US: 4-10 per 1000, approximately 0.8{\%} of live birthds (10)
Incidence in Europe: 6.9/1000 live births
Incidence in Asia: 9.3 per 1000 live births (11)
Incidence metrics vary depending on how old the patient is when the CHD is detected: more severe cases present at earlier stages, but minor defects may not become apparant until the patient is an adult. As screening tools become more effective, it is expected that the incidence rates will increase as defects are detected earlier.
See (16)

Risk factors: genetic syndromes, twins, maternal exposures (smoking during first trimester, especially heavy smokers, binge drinking, binge drinking and smoking, obesity, gestational GM, Folate deficiency, high altitude), and paternal exposures (phthalates, anesthesia, sympathomimetic medications, pesticides, and solvents)

Prevalence: Development of better medical procedures and medications have lead to a decrease in mortality of CHD patients. As of 2000, it is estimated between 800,000 and 850,000 adults and about 859,000 children in the US have CHD. In the same year, Canada reported a CHD prevalance of 11.89 per 1,000 children and 4.09 per 1,000 adults. A report from the Bhabha Atmic Research Centre Hospital in Mumbai estimates the prevalence of CHD at birth to be about 13.28 per 1,000 live births between 2006 and 2011. Information about the prevalence of CHD in other countries is sparse and therefore not reported here.

Cost: high for certain defects, medium costs for surgical interventions for other lesions, still processing

Complications: heart failure, infections?

Mortality: still processing information. Overall, the mortality for CHD patients is declining.},

abstract = {The tracking and compensation of patient motion during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition is an unsolved problem. For brain MRI, a promising approach recently suggested is to track the patient using an in-bore camera and a checkerboard marker attached to the patient's forehead. However, the possible tracking range of the head pose is limited by the fact that the locally attached marker must be entirely visible inside the camera's narrow field of view (FOV). To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a novel self-encoded marker where each feature on the pattern is augmented with a 2-D barcode. Hence, the marker can be tracked even if it is not completely visible in the camera image. Furthermore, it offers considerable advantages over the checkerboard marker in terms of processing speed, since it makes the correspondence search of feature points and marker-model coordinates, which are required for the pose estimation, redundant. The motion correction with the novel self-encoded marker recovered a rotation of 18° around the principal axis of the cylindrical phantom in-between two scans. After rigid registration of the resulting volumes, we measured a maximal error of 0.39 mm and 0.15° in translation and rotation, respectively. In in vivo experiments, the motion compensated images in scans with large motion during data acquisition indicate a correlation of 0.982 compared to a corresponding motion-free reference. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, a fully integrated method for prospective correction of arbitrary rigid body motion employing an external motion tracking device is demonstrated for the first time. The position of the imaging volume is updated prior to every excitation of the spin system. The performance of the available tracking hardware and its connection to the MR imager is analyzed in detail. With the introduction of a novel calibration procedure the accuracy of motion correction is improved compared to previous approaches. Together with the high geometry update rate even freely moving objects can be imaged without motion related artefacts. The high performance and image quality improvement in case of subject motion are demonstrated for various imaging techniques such as gradient and spin echo, as well as echo planar imaging. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In 2004, we launched an active province-wide hospital-based CHD registry in the Guangdong Province of southern China. In this study, we examined the incidence of CHD and its subtypes from 2004 to 2012 and compared our findings to the literature. Our results indicate there is an increasing trend of CHD incidence. The increase in incidence occurred mainly for single lesion and the most common subtypes (e.g., ventricular or atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). There were no increases found for multiple lesions or more complex subtypes. The proportion of CHD cases that were detected early (e.g., 1 week) increased over time. The incidence of CHD stabilized in 2010-2012 with the average cumulative incidences of 9.7, 9.9, and 11.1 per 1,000 live births at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year, respectively. The incidences of CHD subtypes were comparable with recent international results. The data did not support previous reports that Asian children have a higher incidence of pulmonary outflow obstructions and lower incidence of transposition of the great arteries. However, there was a lower incidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstructions observed in our series. The increase in CHD incidence observed over time was due to improved detection and diagnosis. The true incidence of CHD in China was approximately 11.1 per 1,000 live births, which is higher than previously reported.},

Study design: A total of 122 765 consecutive infants born at 18 hospitals throughout China between August 1, 2011, and November 30, 2012, were included. Cases of CHD were identified by echocardiography, clinical assessment, and telephone follow-up. Results: The overall prevalence of CHD was 8.98 per 1000 live births (critical, 1.46; serious, 1.47; significant, 5.00; nonsignificant, 1.07), including 7.15 in male infants and 11.11 in female infants. The most common CHD was ventricular septal defect (3.3), followed by atrial septal defect (1.7), patent ductus arteriosus (0.78), pulmonary stenosis (0.73), tetralogy of Fallot (0.47), and transposition of the great arteries (0.35). Female predominance was observed for all CHD and mild CHD (significant and nonsignificant), and male predominance was observed for the critical CHDs. The proportion of preterm newborns was substantially higher among the major CHD cases (critical and serious) compared with normal newborns. There were appreciably more low birth weight infants among the critical CHD cases compared with normal newborns. Significantly higher rates of ventricular septal defect and atrioventricular septal defect were found in infants born to mothers aged ≥35 years. Extracardiac anomalies were found in 9.3{\%} of CHD cases. The risk of CHD was increased by approximately 3-fold when a first-degree relative had CHD. Conclusions: Our estimates are concordant with data from Western studies. This screening study may provide more accurate and complete information on the overall prevalence of CHD in China.},

The writing committee consisted of experts from North America, South America, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. The committee was divided into subgroups to review key aspects of adult CHD (ACHD) care. Regional representatives were tasked with investigating and reporting on relevant local issues as accurately as possible, within the constraints of available data.

abstract = {BACKGROUND More children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are surviving to adulthood, and CHD is associated with risk factors for dementia. We compared the risk of dementia in CHD adults to that of the general population. METHODS In this cohort study, we used medical registries and a medical record review covering all Danish hospitals to identify adults with CHD diagnosed between 1963 and 2012. These individuals with CHD were followed from January 1, 1981, 30 years of age, or date of first CHD registration (index date for matched members of the general population cohort) until hospital diagnosis of dementia, death, emigration, or end of study (December 31, 2012). For each individual with CHD, we identified 10 members of the general population utilizing the Danish Civil Registration System matched on sex and birth year. We computed cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia, adjusting for sex and birth year. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of dementia was 4{\%} by 80 years of age in 10 632 adults with CHD (46{\%} male). The overall HR comparing adults with CHD with the general population cohort was 1.6 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.0). The HR among individuals with CHD without extracardiac defects was 1.4 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.8). Adults with mild-to-moderate CHD had an HR of 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-2.0), whereas the HR was 2.0 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-3.3) for severe CHD, including univentricular hearts. The HR for early onset dementia ({\textless}65 years of age) was 2.6 (95{\%} CI, 1.8-3.8), whereas the late-onset HR was 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.0-1.8). CONCLUSIONS CHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared with the general population, in particular for early onset dementia. Further understanding of dementia risk in the population with CHD is a potential target for future investigation.},

We examined the segmentation accuracy based on three two-sample validation metrics against the estimated composite latent gold standard, which was derived from several experts' manual segmentations by an EM algorithm. The distribution functions of the tumour and control pixel data were parametrically assumed to be a mixture of two beta distributions with different shape parameters. We estimated the corresponding receiver operating characteristic curve, Dice similarity coefficient, and mutual information, over all possible decision thresholds. Based on each validation metric, an optimal threshold was then computed via maximization. We illustrated these methods on MR imaging data from nine brain tumour cases of three different tumour types, each consisting of a large number of pixels. The automated segmentation yielded satisfactory accuracy with varied optimal thresholds. The performances of these validation metrics were also investigated via Monte Carlo simulation. Extensions of incorporating spatial correlation structures using a Markov random field model were considered. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) has rapidly become a popular technique for the investigation of brain function in healthy individuals, patients as well as in animal studies. However, the BOLD signal arises from a complex mixture of neuronal, metabolic and vascular processes, being therefore an indirect measure of neuronal activity, which is further severely corrupted by multiple non-neuronal fluctuations of instrumental, physiological or subject-specific origin. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing methods for cleaning the BOLD fMRI signal. The description is given from a methodological point of view, focusing on the operation of the different techniques in addition to pointing out the advantages and limitations in their application. Since motion-related and physiological noise fluctuations are two of the main noise components of the signal, techniques targeting their removal are primarily addressed, including both data-driven approaches and using external recordings. Data-driven approaches, which are less specific in the assumed model and can simultaneously reduce multiple noise fluctuations, are mainly based on data decomposition techniques such as principal and independent component analysis. Importantly, the usefulness of strategies that benefit from the information available in the phase component of the signal, or in multiple signal echoes is also highlighted. The use of global signal regression for denoising is also addressed. Finally, practical recommendations regarding the optimization of the preprocessing pipeline for the purpose of denoising and future venues of research are indicated. Through the review, we summarize the importance of signal denoising as an essential step in the analysis pipeline of task-based and resting state fMRI studies.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming an increasingly common form of exami- nation for both adults and children. Although it is non-invasive and considered painless, both adults and children experience anxiety during the examination. The technique is sensitive to motion and for that reason many children are anaesthetised. The aim of this thesis was to improve patient care through exploring adult patients' experiences of undergoing MRI, to examine the value of increased written information for adult patients and to examine whether children receiving age-adjusted preparation and realisation of MRI could go through the examination without deep sedation or anaesthesia. A further aim was to study over a five year period, the commonness of the use of MRI versus CT for children, and the occasions on which the children had deep sedation or anaesthesia.},

abstract = {Application of resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to the study of prematurely born infants enables assessment of the earliest forms of cerebral connectivity and characterization of its early development in the human brain. We obtained 90 longitudinal fcMRI data sets from a cohort of preterm infants aged from 26 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) through term equivalent age at PMA-specific time points. Utilizing seed-based correlation analysis, we identified resting state networks involving varied cortical regions, the thalamus, and cerebellum. Identified networks demonstrated a regionally variable age-specific pattern of development, with more mature forms consisting of localized interhemispheric connections between homotopic counterparts. Anatomical distance was found to play a critical role in the rate of connection development. Prominent differences were noted between networks identified in term control versus premature infants at term equivalent, including in the thalamocortical connections critical for neurodevelopment. Putative precursors of the default mode network were detected in term control infants but were not identified in preterm infants, including those at term equivalent. Identified patterns of network maturation reflect the intricate relationship of structural and functional processes present throughout this important developmental period and are consistent with prior investigations of neurodevelopment in this population. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate whether MR scanners with acoustic noise reduction and a short magnetic bore reduce the rate of claustrophobic reactions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study in an outpatient setting, enrolling a total of 55,734 consecutive patients referred for MRI of any part of the body based on a clinical indication. Imaging was performed using a conventional MR scanner (42,998 patients) and a recently developed MR scanner (12,736 patients) with 97{\%} acoustic noise reduction and a short bore. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the nonrandomized design. RESULTS: In addition to those undergoing head-first examinations, female and middle-aged patients were significantly more likely to develop claustrophobia in the logistic regression analysis (P {\textless} 0.001). The rate of claustrophobic reactions was significantly lower with the recent MR scanner (0.7{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.6-0.9{\%}) than with the conventional scanner (2.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 2.0-2.3{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 3.1 (95{\%} CI, 2.5-3.9) and a number needed to treat of 72 (95{\%} CI, 63-85). CONCLUSION: The incidence of claustrophobia may be reduced by a factor of 3 when recently-developed MR scanners are used.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the proportion of adult patients at our institution who require sedation to tolerate MR imaging. We also wished to identify whether the type of study and patient age or sex was associated with a variation in the use of sedation. A total of 939 patients, 18 years of age or older, underwent MR imaging at a large university hospital during a randomly selected 7-week period. Age, sex, type of study, number of prior MRI's, and use of sedation were identified in this group. Patients requiring sedation were compared by these criteria to all non-sedated members over 18 years of age in the cohort who acted as a control. Of the 939 patients 134 (14.3{\%}) required oral sedation, IV sedation, or general anesthesia to tolerate MRI. This group was 35.8{\%} male, 64.1{\%} female (control group 48.1{\%} male, 51.9{\%} female). Of those requiring sedation, 89 patients (66.4{\%}) were having brain MRI (male n = 29 or 32.6{\%}, female n = 60 or 67.4{\%}). In the control group 461 patients (57.3{\%}) were having brain MRI (male n = 209 or 45.3{\%}, female n = 252 or 54.6{\%}). The mean age of the sedated group was 60.75 (range 19-91). The non-sedated group had a mean age of 67.3 (range 28- 93). The sedated group had undergone a mean of 1.56 prior MR studies (range 0-16); the control group had a mean of 0.9 prior studies (range 0-7). Sedation was more commonly utilized in women than men, in patients having brain MRI, and in patients who had undergone prior MRI procedures. The identification of a population having the greatest need for sedation may aid in the development and selection of methods of stress reduction which will result in greater patient comfort, reduction in motion artifact, and fewer prematurely terminated studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although sedation-related adverse events in children in the hospital setting have been extensively reported, limited data are available regarding adverse events after discharge home. Despite nationally recommended discharge criteria, in busy outpatient settings, children may be sent home into the care of their parents after a brief recovery from sedation, placing them at risk for adverse events in an unmonitored setting. Previous studies have not addressed issues such as requirement for escalation of care after discharge (ie, emergency department visits or hospitalization), or parental satisfaction with their child's sedation experience. This study was undertaken to evaluate the recovery and delayed adverse events after discharge of children who received sedation for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. METHODS: With approval from the institutional review board and written informed consent from a parent, children ({\textless}18 years old) sedated for magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography were studied. Sedative drugs were ordered at the discretion of the radiologist responsible for the procedure in accordance with institutional sedation guidelines and in consideration of the child's health status. Pediatric nurses in the diagnostic areas administered the sedative agent(s) and monitored children according to preestablished institutional guidelines. Demographics, sedative(s) administered, and adverse events including hypoxemia (decrease in SpO(2) by {\textgreater}/=10{\%} of baseline) and sedation events such as inadequate, failed, or excessive sedation, were documented on the institutional quality assurance tool. Children were discharged from the hospital when they met the following preestablished discharge criteria: return to baseline vital signs, level of consciousness close to baseline, and the ability to maintain a patent airway. The following day, parents were telephoned and questioned regarding the child's alertness, side effects, and whether medical follow-up had been sought. Parents also rated their overall satisfaction with the sedation experience. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy six children comprised the sample. Eighty nine percent of children received chloral hydrate (CH; 64 +/- 13 mg/kg), and 11{\%} midazolam (.15 +/-.13 mg/kg) as the primary sedative. There was an 8{\%} incidence of failed sedation, and a 1.6{\%} incidence of hypoxemia during the procedure. Three children required prolonged monitoring in the postanesthesia care unit before discharge; 1 child attributable to an allergic reaction, a second attributable to wheezing and oxygen desaturation, and the third attributable to prolonged sedation from CH and midazolam. These children were discharged home from the postanesthesia care unit without additional sequelae. Side effects after discharge included: motor imbalance (31{\%}), gastrointestinal effects (23{\%}), agitation (19{\%}), and restlessness (14{\%}). Agitation and restlessness lasted greater than 6 hours in more than one third of children who experienced these effects. CH was more commonly associated with imbalance compared with midazolam, and restlessness and prolonged imbalance were associated with younger age. Medical advice was sought after discharge for 15 (4{\%}) children, 3 of whom required a visit to the emergency department for excessive or prolonged sedation. Each of these children had received CH as a sole sedative in recommended doses (61-77 mg/kg). In 1 of these cases, the procedure had been aborted because of inadequate sedation in the hospital, yet the child became difficult to arouse at home. Only 48{\%} of children returned to baseline activity and behavior within 8 hours of the procedure; however, 89{\%} were back to baseline status within 24 hours. Notably, 5{\%} of all children did not return to baseline activity until the second day after the procedure. Although not statistically significant, infants {\textless}12 months old experienced delayed recovery (ie, {\textgreater}/=24 hours) more frequently compared with older c},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Motion artifacts pose significant problems for the acquisition of MR images in pediatric populations. OBJECTIVE To evaluate temporal motion metrics in MRI scanners and their effect on image quality in pediatric populations in neuroimaging studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS We report results from a large pediatric brain imaging study that shows the effect of motion on MRI quality. We measured motion metrics in 82 pediatric patients, mean age 13.4 years, in a T1-weighted brain MRI scan. As a result of technical difficulties, 5 scans were not included in the subsequent analyses. A radiologist graded the images using a 4-point scale ranging from clinically non-diagnostic because of motion artifacts to no motion artifacts. We used these grades to correlate motion parameters such as maximum motion, mean displacement from a reference point, and motion-free time with image quality. RESULTS Our results show that both motion-free time (as a ratio of total scan time) and average displacement from a position at a fixed time (when the center of k-space was acquired) were highly correlated with image quality, whereas maximum displacement was not as good a predictor. Among the 77 patients whose motion was measured successfully, 17 had average displacements of greater than 0.5 mm, and 11 of those (14.3{\%}) resulted in non-diagnostic images. Similarly, 14 patients (18.2{\%}) had less than 90{\%} motion-free time, which also resulted in non-diagnostic images. CONCLUSION We report results from a large pediatric study to show how children and young adults move in the MRI scanner and the effect that this motion has on image quality. The results will help the motion-correction community in better understanding motion patterns in pediatric populations and how these patterns affect MR image quality.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by deficits in social and communication processes. Recent data suggest that altered functional connectivity (FC), i.e. synchronous brain activity, might contribute to these deficits. Of specific interest is the FC integrity of the default mode network (DMN), a network active during passive resting states and cognitive processes related to social deficits seen in ASD, e.g. Theory of Mind. We investigated the role of altered FC of default mode sub-networks (DM-SNs) in 16 patients with high-functioning ASD compared to 16 matched healthy controls of short resting fMRI scans using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a multivariate data-driven approach that identifies temporally coherent networks, providing a natural measure of FC. Results show that compared to controls, patients showed decreased FC between the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, DMN core areas, and other DM-SNs areas. FC magnitude in these regions inversely correlated with the severity of patients' social and communication deficits as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule and the Social Responsiveness Scale. Importantly, supplemental analyses suggest that these results were independent of treatment status. These results support the hypothesis that DM-SNs under-connectivity contributes to the core deficits seen in ASD. Moreover, these data provide further support for the use of data-driven analysis with resting-state data for illuminating neural systems that differ between groups. This approach seems especially well suited for populations where compliance with and performance of active tasks might be a challenge, as it requires minimal cooperation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to lie still in an MRI scanner is essential for obtaining usable image data. To reduce motion, young children are often sedated, adding significant cost and risk. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the feasibility of using a simple and affordable behavioral desensitization program to yield high-quality brain MRI scans in sedation-free children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 222 children (4–9.9 years), 147 with type 1 diabetes and 75 age-matched non-diabetic controls, participated in a multi-site study focused on effects of type 1 diabetes on the developing brain. T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI scans were performed. All children underwent behavioral training and practice MRI sessions using either a commercial MRI simulator or an inexpensive mock scanner consisting of a toy tunnel, vibrating mat, and video player to simulate the sounds and feel of the MRI scanner. RESULTS: 205 children (92.3{\%}), mean age 7±1.7 years had high-quality T1-W scans and 174 (78.4{\%}) had high-quality diffusion-weighted scans after the first scan session. With a second scan session, success rates were 100{\%} and 92.5{\%} for T1-and diffusion-weighted scans, respectively. Success rates did not differ between children with type 1 diabetes and children without diabetes, or between centers using a commercial MRI scan simulator and those using the inexpensive mock scanner. CONCLUSION: Behavioral training can lead to a high success rate for obtaining high-quality T1-and diffusion-weighted brain images from a young population without sedation.},

abstract = {A component based method (CompCor) for the reduction of noise in both blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented. In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR. In comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Head motion systematically distorts clinical and research MRI data. Motion artifacts have biased findings from many structural and functional brain MRI studies. An effective way to remove motion artifacts is to exclude MRI data frames affected by head motion. However, such post-hoc frame censoring can lead to data loss rates of 50{\%} or more in our pediatric patient cohorts. Hence, many scanner operators collect additional ‘buffer data', an expensive practice that, by itself, does not guarantee sufficient high-quality MRI data for a given participant. Therefore, we developed an easy-to-setup, easy-to-use Framewise Integrated Real-time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) software suite that provides scanner operators with head motion analytics in real-time, allowing them to scan each subject until the desired amount of low-movement data has been collected. Our analyses show that using FIRMM to identify the ideal scan time for each person can reduce total brain MRI scan times and associated costs by 50{\%} or more.},

abstract = {Transient magnetic fields induce changes in magnetic resonance (MR) images ranging from small, visually undetectable effects (caused, for instance, by neuronal currents) to more significant ones, such as those created by the gradient fields and eddy currents. Accurately simulating these effects may assist in correcting or optimising MR imaging for many applications (e.g., diffusion imaging, current density imaging, use of magnetic contrast agents, neuronal current imaging, etc.). Here we have extended an existing MR simulator (POSSUM) with a model for changing magnetic fields at a very high-resolution time-scale. This simulator captures a realistic range of scanner and physiological artifacts by modeling the scanner environment, pulse sequence details and subject properties (e.g., brain geometry and air-tissue boundaries).The simulations were validated by using previously published experimental data sets. In the first dataset a transient magnetic field was produced by a single conducting wire with varying current amplitude (between 17 $\mu$A and 765 $\mu$A). The second was identical except that current amplitude was fixed (at 7.8 mA) and current timing varied. A very close match between simulated images and experimental data was observed. In addition, these validation results led to the observation that the current-induced effects included ringing in the image, which extended away from the conductor, primarily in the phase-encode direction. This effect had previously not been noticed in the noisy, experimentally-acquired images, demonstrating one way in which simulated images can provide potential insight into imaging experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the spatial and intensity transformations that are required to adjust for the confounding effects of subject movement during functional MRI (fMRI) activation studies. An approach is presented that models, and removes, movement-related artifacts from fMRI time-series. This approach is predicated on the observation that movement-related effects are extant even after perfect realignment. Movement-related effects can be divided into those that are a function of position of the object in the frame of reference of the scanner and those that are due to movement in previous scans. This second component depends on the history of excitation experienced by spins in a small volume and consequent differences in local saturation. The spin excitation history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous displacements on the current signal. A model is described as well as the adjustments for movement-related components that ensue. The empirical analyses suggest that (in extreme situations) over 90{\%} of fMRI signal can be attributed to movement, and that this artifactual component can be successfully removed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The assessment of motor function is an essential component of neurologic examinations, which imaging studies have extended to the fetus. US assessment is hampered by a limited FOV, whereas MR imaging has the potential to be an alternative. Our objectives were to optimize a cine MR imaging sequence for capturing fetal movements and to perform a pilot analysis of the relationship between the frequency of movements and uterine spatial constrictions in healthy fetuses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, a bSSFP cine sequence was selected for optimization, and various compromises were explored in all acquisition parameters to achieve an effective balance between anatomic coverage of the fetus and the temporal resolution of cine data, with the aim of maximizing both. Subsequently, cross-sectional qualitative and quantitative analyses of fetal movements were performed prospectively by using a cohort of 37 healthy fetuses (median GA, 29 weeks; range, 20-37 weeks) with the optimized cine protocol. Two smaller subgroups were selected for representative sampling of overall behavior patterns by using cine data of longer duration and for volumetric quantification of free intrauterine space. RESULTS: The optimized cine sequence, with TR/TE of 3.21/1.59 ms, coupled with parallel imaging and partial-Fourier imaging, resulted in a section-acquisition time of 0.303 seconds. Anatomic coverage was enhanced by using a combination of thick sagittal sections (30-40 mm) and multisection acquisitions to display movements in all fetal limbs, head, and trunk simultaneously. All expected motor patterns were observed throughout this gestational period, and a significant decreasing trend in overall movement frequency with age was demonstrated (r = -0.514, P = .0011). Also a significant negative correlation was found between overall movement frequency and the total intrauterine free space (r = -0.703, P = .0001). Furthermore, a significant decrease in the frequency of leg movements was shown in fetuses older then 30 weeks' GA compared with those younger than that (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Cine MR imaging is effective for observing fetal movements from midgestation with near full-body coverage. Also, reductions in free space with increasing GA appear to be a factor in the gradual reductions in overall levels of fetal activity as well as in restrictions in movement within specific regions of the fetal anatomy.},

abstract = {Artifactual sources of resting-state (RS) FMRI can originate from head motion, physiology, and hardware. Of these sources, motion has received considerable attention and was found to induce corrupting effects by differentially biasing correlations between regions depending on their distance. Numerous corrective approaches have relied on the identification and censoring of high-motion time points and the use of the brain-wide average time series as a nuisance regressor to which the data are orthogonalized (Global Signal Regression, GSReg). We replicate the previously reported head-motion bias on correlation coefficients and then show that while motion can be the source of artifact in correlations, the distance-dependent bias is exacerbated by GSReg. Put differently, correlation estimates obtained after GSReg are more susceptible to the presence of motion and by extension to the levels of censoring. More generally, the effect of motion on correlation estimates depends on the preprocessing steps leading to the correlation estimate, with certain approaches performing markedly worse than others. For this purpose, we consider various models for RS FMRI preprocessing and show that the local white matter regressor (WMe LOCAL ), a subset of ANATICOR, results in minimal sensitivity to motion and reduces by extension the dependence of correlation results on censoring.},

abstract = {Many components of resting-state (RS) FMRI show non-random structure that has little to do with neural connectivity but can covary over multiple brain structures. Some of these signals originate in physiology and others are hardware-related. One artifact discussed herein may be caused by defects in the receive coil array or the RF amplifiers powering it. During a scan, this artifact results in small image intensity shifts in parts of the brain imaged by the affected array components. These shifts introduce artifactual correlations in RS time series on the spatial scale of the coil's sensitivity profile, and can markedly bias RS connectivity results. We show that such a transient artifact can be substantially removed from RS time series by using locally formed regressors from white matter tissue. This is particularly important in arrays with larger numbers of coils, which may generate smaller artifact zones. In such a case, brain-wide average noise estimates would fail to capture the artifact. We also examine the anatomical structure of artifactual variance in RS FMRI time series, by identifying sources that contribute to these signals and where in the brain are they manifested. We consider current methods for reducing confounding sources (or noises) and their effects on connectivity maps, and offer an improved approach (ANATICOR) that can also reduce hardware artifacts. The methods described herein are currently available with AFNI, in addition to tools for rapid, interactive generation of seed-based correlation maps at single-subject and group levels. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are highly sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare 8 popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, including methods such as regression of head motion parameters (with or without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 16 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in three independent datasets that were characterized by both high and low levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in comparisons between people with schizophrenia (SCZ; n = 50) and HCs (n = 121) and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 34) and HCs (n = 39). Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines can exacerbate motion artefacts in low-motion data; (3) the primary benefit of volume censoring comes from the exclusion of high-motion individuals rather than censoring of data in remaining participants; and (4) that ICA-AROMA consistently performed well across all benchmarks and datasets, particularly when applied after the exclusion of high-motion individuals. ICA-AROMA was also the most sensitive to clinical differences in case-control analyses, suggesting that its denoising efficacy is associated with enhanced power for detecting pathophysiological effects. Crucially, the comparison between HC and SCZ revealed that the specific choice of noise correction pipeline had a major effect on the findings, affecting both the location and direction of group differences. Putative increases in functional connectivity in patients only emerged in pipelines incorporating either global signal regression or aCompCor. Thus, group comparisons in functional connectivity are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline some simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.},

abstract = {The impact of in-scanner head movement on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals has long been established as undesirable. These effects have been traditionally corrected by methods such as linear regression of head movement parameters. However, a number of recent independent studies have demonstrated that these techniques are insufficient to remove motion confounds, and that even small movements can spuriously bias estimates of functional connectivity. Here we propose a new data-driven, spatially-adaptive, wavelet-based method for identifying, modeling, and removing non-stationary events in fMRI time series, caused by head movement, without the need for data scrubbing. This method involves the addition of just one extra step, the Wavelet Despike, in standard pre-processing pipelines. With this method, we demonstrate robust removal of a range of different motion artifacts and motion-related biases including distance-dependent connectivity artifacts, at a group and single-subject level, using a range of previously published and new diagnostic measures. The Wavelet Despike is able to accommodate the substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity of motion artifacts and can consequently remove a range of high and low frequency artifacts from fMRI time series, that may be linearly or non-linearly related to physical movements. Our methods are demonstrated by the analysis of three cohorts of resting-state fMRI data, including two high-motion datasets: a previously published dataset on children (N= 22) and a new dataset on adults with stimulant drug dependence (N= 40). We conclude that there is a real risk of motion-related bias in connectivity analysis of fMRI data, but that this risk is generally manageable, by effective time series denoising strategies designed to attenuate synchronized signal transients induced by abrupt head movements.

abstract = {Head motion is a significant source of noise in the estimation of functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Current strategies to reduce this noise include image realignment, censoring time points corrupted by motion, and including motion realignment parameters and their derivatives as additional nuisance regressors in the general linear model. However, this nuisance regression approach assumes that the motion-induced signal changes are linearly related to the estimated realignment parameters, which is not always the case. In this study we develop an improved model of motion-related signal changes, where nuisance regressors are formed by first rotating and translating a single brain volume according to the estimated motion, re-registering the data, and then performing a principal components analysis (PCA) on the resultant time series of both moved and re-registered data. We show that these “Motion Simulated (MotSim)” regressors account for significantly greater fraction of variance, result in higher temporal signal-to-noise, and lead to functional connectivity estimates that are less affected by motion compared to the most common current approach of using the realignment parameters and their derivatives as nuisance regressors. This improvement should lead to more accurate estimates of functional connectivity, particularly in populations where motion is prevalent, such as patients and young children.},

We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10 seconds after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects},

abstract = {Head motion during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning can induce spurious findings and/or harm detection of true effects. Solutions have been proposed, including deleting ('scrubbing') or regressing out ('spike regression') motion volumes from fMRI time-series. These strategies remove motion-induced signal variations at the cost of destroying the autocorrelation structure of the fMRI time-series and reducing temporal degrees of freedom. ICA-based fMRI denoising strategies overcome these drawbacks but typically require re-training of a classifier, needing manual labeling of derived components (e.g. ICA-FIX; Salimi-Khorshidi et al. (2014)). Here, we propose an ICA-based strategy for Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA) that uses a small (n = 4), but robust set of theoretically motivated temporal and spatial features. Our strategy does not require classifier re-training, retains the data's autocorrelation structure and largely preserves temporal degrees of freedom. We describe ICA-AROMA, its implementation, and initial validation. ICA-AROMA identified motion components with high accuracy and robustness as illustrated by leave-N-out cross-validation. We additionally validated ICA-AROMA in resting-state (100 participants) and task-based fMRI data (118 participants). Our approach removed (motion-related) spurious noise from both rfMRI and task-based fMRI data to larger extent than regression using 24 motion parameters or spike regression. Furthermore, ICA-AROMA increased sensitivity to group-level activation. Our results show that ICA-AROMA effectively reduces motion-induced signal variations in fMRI data, is applicable across datasets without requiring classifier re-training, and preserves the temporal characteristics of the fMRI data.},

abstract = {Over the last five years, new ``voxel-based'' approaches have allowed important progress in multimodal image registration, notably due to the increasing use of information-theoretic similarity measures. Their wide success has led to the progressive abandon of measures using standard image statistics (mean and variance). Until now, such measures have essentially been based on heuristics. In this paper, we address the determination of a new measure based on standard statistics from a theoretical point of view. We show that it naturally leads to a known concept of probability theory, the correlation ratio. In our derivation, we take as the hypothesis the functional dependence between the image intensities. Although such a hypothesis is not as general as possible, it enables us to model the image smoothness prior very easily. We also demonstrate results of multimodal rigid registration involving Magnetic Resonance (MR), Computed Tomography (CT), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. These results suggest that the correlation ratio provides a good trade-off between accuracy and robustness.},

@article{Salimi-Khorshidi2014,
abstract = {Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) - one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data - has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components, if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce FIX ("FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier"), which provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95{\%} overall accuracy. On high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over 99{\%} classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly available as a plugin for FSL. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Several recent reports in large, independent samples have demonstrated the influence of motion artifact on resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfc-MRI). Standard rsfc-MRI preprocessing typically includes regression of confounding signals and band-pass filtering. However, substantial heterogeneity exists in how these techniques are implemented across studies, and no prior study has examined the effect of differing approaches for the control of motion-induced artifacts. To better understand how in-scanner head motion affects rsfc-MRI data, we describe the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of motion artifacts in a sample of 348 adolescents. Analyses utilize a novel approach for describing head motion on a voxelwise basis. Next, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of a range of confound regression and filtering techniques for the control of motion-induced artifacts. Results reveal that the effectiveness of preprocessing procedures on the control of motion is heterogeneous, and that improved preprocessing provides a substantial benefit beyond typical procedures. These results demonstrate that the effect of motion on rsfc-MRI can be substantially attenuated through improved preprocessing procedures, but not completely removed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({\textgreater} 0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks - two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions - a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Introduction : MRI in small children as a general rule necessitates the use of general anesthesia. We describe our initial results with a new technique which we name the feed and sleep method whereby an infant can undergo a Cardiac MRI without the need for general anesthesia or sedation. Methods The infant is starved for 4 hours prior to the scan and is then fed by his mother prior to the scan. He is then swaddled with 1 to 2 infant sheets before placed within a vacuum-bag immobilizer. As air is removed from the bag, the immobilizer becomes a rigid cradle that fits the infant's body. We prioritize the sequences to target the area of importance first according to the purposes of the study and in the order of clinical importance. Results Between Jan and July 2010 a total of 12 infants median age 14 days (minimum 2 days maximum 150 days) have undergone CMR studies via this method. All were performed successfully with no distress to the infant.The average scan time was 45.5 min (minimum 24, maximum 65 min). All had complex congenital heart defects (Table 1) and all planned sequences were able to be acquired ensuring the scans were of sufficient quality to allow accurate diagnosis and to plan appropriate future surgery. Conclusion Using this technique infants under the age of 6 months can complete a cardiovascular MRI, without the need for general anesthesia. We advocate the incorporation of this safe and reliable technique into routine clinical practice. (Table Presented).},

abstract = {Functional connectomics is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of neuroimaging research. Yet, concerns remain regarding the use of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) to characterize inter-individual variation in the functional connectome. In particular, recent findings that "micro" head movements can introduce artifactual inter-individual and group-related differences in R-fMRI metrics have raised concerns. Here, we first build on prior demonstrations of regional variation in the magnitude of framewise displacements associated with a given head movement, by providing a comprehensive voxel-based examination of the impact of motion on the BOLD signal (i.e., motion-BOLD relationships). Positive motion-BOLD relationships were detected in primary and supplementary motor areas, particularly in low motion datasets. Negative motion-BOLD relationships were most prominent in prefrontal regions, and expanded throughout the brain in high motion datasets (e.g., children). Scrubbing of volumes with FD. {\textgreater}0.2 effectively removed negative but not positive correlations; these findings suggest that positive relationships may reflect neural origins of motion while negative relationships are likely to originate from motion artifact. We also examined the ability of motion correction strategies to eliminate artifactual differences related to motion among individuals and between groups for a broad array of voxel-wise R-fMRI metrics. Residual relationships between motion and the examined R-fMRI metrics remained for all correction approaches, underscoring the need to covary motion effects at the group-level. Notably, global signal regression reduced relationships between motion and inter-individual differences in correlation-based R-fMRI metrics; Z-standardization (mean-centering and variance normalization) of subject-level maps for R-fMRI metrics prior to group-level analyses demonstrated similar advantages. Finally, our test-retest (TRT) analyses revealed significant motion effects on TRT reliability for R-fMRI metrics. Generally, motion compromised reliability of R-fMRI metrics, with the exception of those based on frequency characteristics - particularly, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). The implications of our findings for decision-making regarding the assessment and correction of motion are discussed, as are insights into potential differences among volume-based metrics of motion. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Graph theoretical explorations of functional interactions within the human connectome, are rapidly advancing our understanding of brain architecture. In particular, global and regional topological parameters are increasingly being employed to quantify and characterize inter-individual differences in human brain function. Head motion remains a significant concern in the accurate determination of resting-state fMRI based assessments of the connectome, including those based on graph theoretical analysis (e.g., motion can increase local efficiency, while decreasing global efficiency and small-worldness). This study provides a comprehensive examination of motion correction strategies on the relationship between motion and commonly used topological parameters. At the individual-level, we evaluated different models of head motion regression and scrubbing, as well as the potential benefits of using partial correlation (estimated via graphical lasso) instead of full correlation. At the group-level, we investigated the utility of regression of motion and mean intrinsic functional connectivity before topological parameters calculation and/or after. Consistent with prior findings, none of the explicit motion-correction approaches at individual-level were able to remove motion relationships for topological parameters. Global signal regression (GSR) emerged as an effective means of mitigating relationships between motion and topological parameters; though at the risk of altering the connectivity structure and topological hub distributions when higher density graphs are employed (e.g., {\textgreater}6{\%}). Group-level analysis correction for motion was once again found to be a crucial step. Finally, similar to recent work, we found a constellation of findings suggestive of the possibility that some of the motion-relationships detected may reflect neural or trait signatures of motion, rather than simply motion-induced artifact.},

abstract = {Due to the intrinsic low sensitivity of BOLD-fMRI long scanning is required. Subject motion during fMRI scans reduces statistical significance of the activation maps and increases the prevalence of false activations. Motion correction is therefore an essential tool for a successful fMRI data analysis. Retrospective motion correction techniques are now commonplace and are incorporated into a wide range of fMRI analysis toolboxes. These techniques are advantageous due to robustness, sequence independence and have minimal impact on the fMRI study setup. Retrospective techniques however, do not provide an accurate intra-volume correction, nor can these techniques correct for the spin-history effects. The application of prospective motion correction in fMRI appears to be effective in reducing false positives and increasing sensitivity when compared to retrospective techniques, particularly in the cases of substantial motion. Especially advantageous in this regard is the combination of prospective motion correction with dynamic distortion correction. Nevertheless, none of the recent methods are able to recover activations in presence of motion that are comparable to no-motion conditions, which motivates further research in the area of adaptive dynamic imaging.},

abstract = {In children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in various brain regions, including prefrontal-striatal circuit, cerebellum, and brainstem. In the current study, we used a new marker of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) to investigate the baseline brain function of this disorder. Thirteen boys with ADHD (13.0 ± 1.4 years) were examined by resting-state fMRI and compared with age-matched controls. As a result, we found that patients with ADHD had decreased ALFF in the right inferior frontal cortex, left sensorimotor cortex, and bilateral cerebellum and the vermis as well as increased ALFF in the right anterior cingulated cortex, left sensorimotor cortex, and bilateral brainstem. This resting-state fMRI study suggests that the changed spontaneous neuronal activity of these regions may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology in children with ADHD. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.
