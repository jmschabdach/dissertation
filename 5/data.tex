\chapter{DATA}
\label{ch5:data}

The data used to test the hypothesis and aims introduced in the previous chapter are drawn from a set of simulated rs-fMRI sequences and four clinical groups. In this chapter, we will first discuss the mechanism built to simulate brain activity, scanner noise, and motion in rs-fMRI sequences. Then we will discuss the clinical images. Because motion causes problems in MR images across all stages of life, we used images from cohorts of healthy and CHD fetal, neonatal, and preadolescent subjects as well as images of aging subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.

\section{Simulated Sequences}

\subsection{SPECTr: Simulated Phantom Emulating Cranial Transformations}

Every MRI scanner is different, so a stand-in model for an organ or tissue type is often used to calibrate an MRI scanner. The model is designed to have specific physical properties which mimic the physical properties of the organ or tissue. These properties can be accurately measured during the design process of this model so that the radiologist or researcher looking at images of the model can know the ground truth of the model. Because these models mimic true organs and tissues, they are called phantoms. 

We will generate a simulated phantom image using the rs-fMRI of a healthy adult male. A single volume will be selected from the rs-fMRI sequence. This volume will be duplicated to create a generated image with 150 instances of the same volume. This sequence will be our base phantom sequence. 

A copy of the base phantom sequence will be made and a subvolume in the same location of every volume will be selected. In the subvolume of each frame, a small amount of noise generated using a normal Gaussian distribution will be added to simulate changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal over time. The noise will be generated from a normal Gaussian distribution will be added to each frame. This image sequence will be referred to as our BOLD phantom sequence.

\section{Congenital Heart Disease Cohorts}

Congenital heart defects and congenital heart disease (CHD) both refer to defects in the heart or the vessels around the heart which formed during  fetal development. Heart defects affect how blood moves into, through, and away from the heart. However, cardiac conditions are not the only complications CHD must deal with. In recent years, researchers have found that there is a relationship between CHD and neurocognitive disorders. The CHD rs-fMRIs used in this study were gathered as part of ongoing studies of the relationship between CHD and neurodevelopment. Data from these studies was obtained through studies approved by the IRB at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh. The data is stored and accessed in compliance with all HIPPA policies.

\subsection{CHD and Neurodevelopment}

CHD consists of a variety of defects affect the vessels and chambers of the heart. It has a worldwide prevalence of about 8 per 1000 live births, meaning about 1.35 million children are born with CHD every year. Since the survivability of CHD has increased from 10\% to 90\%, the medical community is faced with a growing, aging population of CHD patients. Many of these patients also suffer from neurocognitive disorders that co-occur with CHD. The neurocognitive disorders are usually diagnosed using at least one of many psychological survey-based evaluations, but these methods are subjective. rs-fMRIs could be used to identify patients who have functional connectivity patterns associated with different neurocognitive disorders, and eventually may be used to identify patients who are at risk for developing these disorders.

CHD can affect any combination of heart chambers and blood vessels with varying degrees of severity. The lesions prevent the cardiopulmonary system as a whole from functioning correctly, but pinpointing and treating the defects effectively can be a complex process.
 
% Causes of CHD: genetic syndromes, single gene mutations, environmental exposure, and unknown
There are a number of genetic and environmental factors associated with different presentations of CHD \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Noonan syndrome are associated with different CHD presentations. Maternal behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking are known to cause heart problems in the fetus. Other maternal risk factors are obesity, folate deficiency, and living at a high altitude. Paternal exposure to phthalates, anesthesia, sympathomimetic medications, pesticides, and solvents may increase the risk of the fetus for developing CHD. While there are quite a few factors in this list, there are many CHD cases whose causes are unknown.

\label{ch5:fig:usa-defects-prev}
\end{figure}

% Diagnosis
The process of diagnosing CHD can begin before birth. A specialized ultrasound test called fetal echocardiography can detect heart abnormalities as early as the second trimester of the pregnancy. Additional tests, such as amniocentesis and follow-up ultrasounds may be used to determine treatment options before the patient is born. Generally, severe CHD cases present and are detected at earlier stages, but minor defects may not become apparent until the patient is older. Tests used to diagnose CHD in postnatal patients include electro- and echo-cardiograms, chest x-rays, pulse oximetry, exercise stress tests, computed tomography or MRI scans, and cardiac catheterization. Treatment of different defects varies from monitoring and medication to surgery and cardiac implants.

The incidence of CHD in live births vary across countries and continents. The United States reports approximately 4-10 CHD case per 1000 live births. Europe and Asia see about 6.9 and 9.3 CHD cases per 1000 live births \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. 
In China, the incidence of CHD ranges from 8.98 to 11.1 per 1000 live births \cite{Zhao2019} \cite{Qu2016}. 
A pair of studies from Iran report incidences of 8.6 and 12.3 per 1000 live births, though the studies note that they were performed in different geographical locations with different populations within the country \cite{Nikyar2011} \cite{Rahim2008}.
One report from Dharan reports an incidence of 5.8 per 1000 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a 12 month period \cite{Shah2008}. A study of newborns at one hospital in New Delhi, India claims an incidence of 3.9 per 1000 live births, though this rate may be a poor estimate as there is a significant delay between patient birth and referral to a cardiac center in India \cite{Khalil1994} \cite{Saxena2005}.

These incidence rates should be analyzed with some caution. In many cases, the reported rates were based on medical records. Medical records are not always correct. Additionally, the only way for a person to have a medical record is for him to go to a medical center. Not everyone who has CHD is able to seek medical help, often because of their geographical locations or their income. Even if a patient is able to seek medical help, the availability of proper cardiac care varies between and within countries. 

As screening tools become more effective and more widespread, it is expected that incidence rates will increase as defects are detected earlier. Generally, the earlier a defect is detected, the earlier it can be treated. Early detection and treatment means more CHD patients will live to adulthood. Currently, Webb et al. estimate that at least 12 to 34 million adults have CHD, and this number is expected to increase \cite{Webb2015}.

It is important to note that each defect type has a different prevalence, a different treatment plan, and different expected outcomes. A breakdown of prevalence rates of some of the most common lesion types can be seen in Figure \ref{ch5:fig:usa-defects-prev}. % See (16)
Once a patient is diagnosed with one of these defects, the specific nature of his case must be clearly documented. The documentation of CHD using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) has 25 high level codes representing various presentations of CHD, but these codes used alone are often not sufficient for describing a patient's true condition \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Additional ICD-9-CM codes should be used to communicate the finer details of a patient's condition.

\label{ch5:fig:CHD-burden}

\end{figure}

%Depending on the cause of the 
The financial burden of CHD varies depending on the defect. Certain defects require complex, expensive surgical repairs while others can be treated with less expensive approaches \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. The burden of CHD across the globe was outlined by Webb et al. Their figure illustrating the prevalence of CHD and the availability of funds with which to treat it can be see in Figure \ref{ch5:fig:CHD-burden}. As the overall mortality of CHD declines, the burden of CHD is expected to increase \cite{Mozaffarian2016}.

% Complications and risks
Unfortunately, the cost of treating CHD alone is not the only burden a patient must undergo. Patients with CHD are also at increased risk for heart failure and infections \cite{Mozaffarian2016}. Children with CHD are at 19-fold risk for stroke compared to their healthy counterparts \cite{Fox2015}. In a study of Swedish citizens born between 1970 and 1993, Giang et al performed a study compared the prevalence of cardiac conditions in patients with and without CHD \cite{Giang2018}. They found that patients who had a CHD diagnosis were at about eight times higher risk for intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage than their non-CHD counterparts. The CHD patients were also more likely to suffer from arrhythmia and heart failure.

\subsection{Potential Causes of Neurodevelopmental Complications}

Early research in this area focuses on the neurodevelopmental status of neonatal patients pre- and post-surgical intervention. One theory was that some factor or factors in the surgical intervention caused brain injuries in the patients. This idea proved to be inaccurate when researchers began detecting neurological malformations \textit{in utero}.

In a systematic review of available literature regarding prenatal and postnatal presurgical CHD cases and neurodevelopmental outcomes, Mebius et al. identify two theories about the causality of  neurodevelopmental delays and CHD \cite{Mebius2017}. The first theory is that abnormalities in the cardiac system prevent the developing brain from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients, which disrupts prenatal brain development. The second theory is that faulty genetic pathways used during both cardiac and brain development cause both conditions to co-occur. However, 11 articles Mebius et al. found during their review that are related to bloodflow through the umbilical artery suggest a third theory. During the prenatal period, a fetus receives oxygen from the mother via the placenta. If the placenta was not functioning correctly, it could lead to the fetus receiving not enough oxygen. Lower quantities of oxygen throughout prenatal development could potentially cause problems both in brain and cardiac growth. The 11 articles have contradictory results, but some researchers are currently investigating the role of the placenta in CHD and prenatal brain development.

%\subsection{Common Disorder Combinations}

\subsection{Aging}

Survival of CHD patients to adulthood has increased from 10\% to 90\% over the last several decades. The impact of the combination of CHD and neurological conditions throughout a patient's lifetime is starting to be explored. The aging of the CHD population has also sparked interest in the relationships between CHD and adult-stage neurological disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's.

\subsection{Identifying Neurocognitive Disorders}

\subsubsection{Patient Surveys}

Surveys known to be used for studying the relationship between CHD and neurodevelopment are

\begin{itemize}
\item National Institute of Health Toolbox (3 - 85 years): ``Performance tests of cognitive, motor, and sensory function and self-reported measures of emotional function for adults and children in the general population and those living with a chronic condition''.

\item Sue Beers (4 - 18 years [not inclusive of 18 years]): WASI-II, NEPSY-2, WRAML-2, D-KEFS, WISC-IV, Grooved Pegboard, BRIEF, Beery-Buktenica VMI, ASRS, Conners-3, BASC-II, ABAS-II, PedsQL General, PedsQL Cardiac, Pictoral Scale Self Perception Profile.

\item SVR-III NDT (9 - 13 years [not inclusive of 13 years]): WIAT, NEPSY, WRAML, D-KEFS, WISC-V, Grooved Pegboard, BRIEF, Beery-Buktenica VMI, ASRS, Conners ADHD Index, BASC-II, ABAS-3, PedsQL General, PedsQL Cardiac

\item Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development -III (1 - 24 months): Subtests include cognitive, language, social-emotional, motor, and adaptive behavior tests \cite{Mebius2017}.

\item Battelle Developmental Inventory (Birth - 8 years [not inclusive of 8 years]): Subsets include cognition, communication, social-emotional development, physical development, and adaptive behavior.

\item Developmental Assessment of Young Children (Birth - 6 years [not inclusive of 6 years]): Subtests include cognition, communication, social-emotional development, physical development, and adaptive behavior.

\item Preschool Language Scale + Receptive-Expressive Emergent Language (Birth - 3 years): Total language, auditory comprehension, expressive communication, articulation, receptive language, expressive language, and inventory of vocabulary words.

\item Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (Birth - 5 years): Subtests include reflexes, stationary, locomotion, object manipulation, grasping, visual-motor integration
\end{itemize}

The goal of these surveys is to compare the patient's cognitive function and neurological functions to expected milestones. Certain deviations from certain milestones are indicative of different disorders.

\subsubsection{Neurological Images}

When an area of the brain is active, it uses more oxygen than the surrounding regions. Functional MRIs (fMRI) are sensitive to signals emitted by deoxygenated hemoglobin. The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded by the fMRI reveal regions of the brain which are active at the same time. These combinations of regions are called neuronal networks. 

Many neuronal networks exist, but most of them are considered to be task related. In 2001, Raichle et al. suggested the existence of a neuronal network which operated when a person is at rest \cite{Raichle2001}. Their theory was confirmed by Greicius et al. in 2003 \cite{Greicius2003}. Because the patient is not performing a specific task when they are in a resting state, the resting-state networks have the potential to reveal valuable information about a patient's neurodevelopmental status.

A fMRI taken of a patient in a resting, task-free state, is called a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). rs-fMRIs are sequences of image volumes acquired over a period of a few minutes. The image volumes themselves have relatively low spatial resolution when compared to structural MRIs, but their temporal resolution is significantly higher as a new volume is acquired every two to three seconds. 

The BOLD signals in rs-fMRI image sequences are analyzed using a process called functional connectivity analysis. Functional connectivity analysis identifies patterns and networks of brain activity. Some functional connectivity analysis studies have lead to the discoveries of links between specific disruptions in these naturally occurring networks and neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \cite{Assaf2010} \cite{Zang2007}. With further refinements of both acquisition techniques and characterization of these functional networks, clinicians may be able to use rs-fMRI to evaluate the neurodevelopmental status of CHD patients and to identify patients who may benefit from certain therapies or neuroprotective interventions.

\subsection{CHD Subjects}

\subsubsection{Neonatal Subject Population and Images}

Neonatal subjects are recruited as part of a prospective observational study. The subjects were scanned using a 3T Skyra (Siemans AG, Erlangen, Germany). They were unsedated during the scans and a ``feed and bundle'' protocol was used to prevent motion during the scans \cite{Windram2011}. The newborns were positioned in the coil to minimize head tilting. Newborns were fitted with earplugs (Quiet Earplugs; Sperian Hearing Protection, San Diego, CA) and neonatal ear muffs (MiniMuffs; Natus, San Carlos, CA). An MR-compatible vital signs monitoring system (Veris, MEDRAD, Inc. Indianola, PA) was used to monitor neonatal vital signs. All scans were performed using a multi-channel head coil. The parameters for the resting-state BOLD MR scans were FOV=240 mm and TE/TR=32/2020 ms with interplane resolution of 4x4 mm, slice thickness of 4 mm, and 4 mm space between slices. The acquired images contained 150 volumes where each volume consisted of 64x64x32 voxels$^3$.

\subsubsection{Preadolescent Subject Population and Images}

As part of a multicenter study of CHD in preadolescents, we collected rs-fMRIs from nine sites throughout the United States. These images were of patients in the age range of 9 to 13 years who either had CHD or were healthy with no neurocognitive impairments. In addition to the MRI scans, subjects who participated in this study were asked to participate in additional testing  either to determine their neurocognitive outcome status or to perform genetic analyses. % (GET DETAILS FROM NANCY).

\subsubsection{Fetal Subject Population and Images}

%Real goal is to develop a method of registering fetal brain and placental images so that we can further examine the relationship between placental oxygen levels and fetal brain development. Longitudinally, this technique can be used to determine how placental oxygen flow and fetal brain development impact a patient over the course of his or her life. Once the relationship between the placenta and fetal brain development is better understood, we can determine a set of neuroprotective interventions to employ for at-risk patients before they are born.

Fetal subjects have different constraints on their physical environment than neonates, preadolescents, and adults. As a result, they exhibit unique patterns of motion. The previous subject cohorts discussed in this chapter have the following commonalities: the subject experiences the full effects of gravity, the subject is lying on his back in an MRI scanner, and the subject's head motion is limited by the head coil within the MRI. Any motion in these images is a direct result of the subject himself moving, whether passively (cardiac motion and breathing) or actively (fidgeting or looking around).

A fetal subject is scanned in vivo. He is suspended in amniotic fluid within his mother. The amniotic fluid has buoyancy that reduces the effects of gravity and allows a fetal subject significant freedom of movement. The fetus can rotate, shift, and flip in ways that can only be accomplished when floating in a body of water. The properties of the uterus constrain the physical space in which a motion could occur, but not as much as the head coil and gravity do to the other patient cohorts. A fetus is not guaranteed to be in any specific position at the start of the scan: the scan begins when the mother is ready, not when the fetus achieves a certain pose. 

The fetal subjects underwent fetal echocardiography scans in a cardiac clinic to determine whether they were healthy or had a form of CHD. They were then scanned on an MRI scanner. Images of the fetal brain and the placenta were acquired for each subject. 

We are interested in both the fetal brain and placental images for our work because of the relationship between placenta and brain development. However, these organs have very different physical properties. The fetal brain is a rigid structure floating and moving within the amneotic fluid. It undergoes translation and rotation as a single unit due to passive and active maternal and fetal motions. The placenta, on the other hand, is anchored in place on the uterine wall. It may undergo small translations or rotations due to maternal motion, but it will respond differently to fetal motion. Fetal motions cause nonlinear deformations of the pliable placenta that can only be adequately accounted for using nonlinear registration algorithms. Nonlinear registrations have the potential to deform brain images into physically impossible shapes, so the fetal brain and placenta were manually segmented in their respective images so that each organ could undergo independent motion correction. 

The segmenters were one of a group of four researchers. While one researcher trained the other three group members, the interrater agreement between them is still being determined.

\section{Aging Brain Subjects}

The final data set we use is from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).

%The second adult cohort comes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The ADNI study has been working since 2004 to further Alzheimer's research by gathering, analyzing, and sharing clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers from the elderly population. The group gathers data from 63 sites in the United States and Canada. During the second phase of the study, sites who have a Philips MRI system gathered resting-state fMRIs from their subjects. This data is freely available to academic researchers through the LONI Image and Data Archive.

\section{Purpose for each cohort}

\subsection{Simulated Phantom}

The phantom experiments will be used to probe the volume registration technique. By applying the DAG-based and traditional registration techniques to the base phantom sequence, we will be able to evaluate the degrees of positional and signal change errors each technique may introduce into the registration process. After determining the baseline error, we will apply both registration techniques to the BOLD phantom sequence. The registered versions of the BOLD phantom sequence will be compared to each other and to the original BOLD phantom sequence to determine how well each registration retains the BOLD signal.

This particular experiment will be one of the first to investigate how much true BOLD signal is preserved through motion correction. One of the major drawbacks to existing motion correction pipelines is that they remove signal along with noise. In clinical data, there is no way to know the ground truth signal contained within the image; however, simulated phantom images have a de facto known ground truth signal. The design for this experiment can be used to evaluate how much BOLD signal is recovered by other motion correction pipelines, and how close the recovered signal is to the signal of interest.

\subsection{Clinical Images}
%For each subject in a cohort of 74 healthy neonatal subjects, at least one rs-fMRI was acquired. The images underwent motion correction using a pipeline developed by Power et al. \cite{Power2014}. The motion corrected image were compared to Power et al.'s thresholds of acceptability for their FD and DVARS metrics \cite{Power2014}. Of the 74 subjects in this cohort, 17 subjects had rs-fMRIs which did not meet Power et al.'s usability criteria. These high motion images were used in our study.

\textbf{Neonatal Cohort.} Our set of neonatal subjects includes a cohort of 74 healthy neonates. Each subject in this cohort underwent an MRI scan, and the rs-fMRIs obtained during this process were compared to Power et al.'s positional and signal change usability thresholds. Of the 74 subjects, 17 of them had rs-fMRIs which did not meet the usability criteria. These high motion images were used to test the feasibility of the DAG-based volume registration framework. 

These images were ideal for the feasibility study for three reasons. First, the neonates were healthy, which eliminates disease status as a confounding variable in the analysis of the registered images. Second, the neonates in this study were scanned using a feed and sleep protocol. Because the neonates were asleep during the scan, they generally did not move very much. The high-motion neonates are an obvious exception to this concept, but many of the high-motion images contained long periods where the subject was stationary. Evaluating the DAG-based framework on data with various patterns of motion and different periods of low and high motion allowed us to explore the effects of the DAG-based algorithm in different combinations of motion features. Third, these images were too corrupted by motion to be used in other analyses. Applying both the DAG-based framework and the traditional registration framework to these images provided the opportunity to compare the performances of both registration frameworks to each other in the context of the usability gold standard thresholds. 

\textbf{Preadolescent Cohort.} The multicenter imaging study of preadolescent subjects provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the DAG-based framework on a large subject cohort containing variable amounts of motion. The outcome of this experiment will be used in the next experiment to determine if there are any site-specific or vendor-specific variables influencing patient motion.

\textbf{Adult Cohort.} The adult cohort encompass many clinical outcomes and a wider age range than the other clinical populations. 

\textbf{Fetal Cohort.} As the fetal subjects have both neurological and placental images, their data will be used to examine the impact of volume registration on different organ types.

\section{Summary}
