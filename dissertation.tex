\documentclass[pdftex,final]{pittetd}
%final, makes pittetd's warnings (about things that might go against the Format Guidelines) into error messages. 
%Option 'sectionletters' numbers the chapters with Roman numerals (I, II, etc.), sections with 
%letters (A, B), subsections with numbers (1, 2), and subsubsections with lowercase letters (a, b). 
%The four levels of the enumerate environment receive the same treatment. Within the
%text, however, cross references (\ref} produce `the whole thing,' something like I.A.1 
%instead of only 1.

\begin{abstract}
Approximately 1.35 million children are diagnoses with a congenital heart defect (CHD) annually. As the process of diagnosing and treating CHD has improved, the expected lifespan of CHD patients has increased: at least 12 to 34 million adults worldwide have CHD. A larger population living with CHD means that clinicials are learning more about conditions which CHD patients are at increased risk of getting. Some of these conditions affect the patient's neurodevelopment and neurocognitive status. Diagnosis of the neurocognitive conditions is performed using surveys, but examining the structure and function of the brain could offer more objective diagnoses. 

One tool useful for examining a patient's brain is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in particular can be used to reveal information about the neuronal networks in the patient's brain. Unfortunately, rs-fMRIs are highly susceptible to motion. Clinical and behavioral techniques can help patients move less during a rs-fMRI scan, though they do not guarantee motion-free images. Various sensors can be used to monitor and correct for motion during the scan, but these sensors are useless when it comes to recovering previously acquired rs-fMRIs corrupted by motion.

We devised a novel approach to volume registration, which is the first step in motion correction. We compare it to traditional volume registration in the context of a complete motion correction pipeline. The registration techniques and pipeline were applied to neurological rs-fMRIs of fetal, neonatal, preadolescent, and adult patients with CHD as well as several phantom images. We identified different motion patterns specific to different demographic groups, and discovered relationships between certain motion patterns and clinical outcomes associated with CHD and different neurodevelopmental conditions.

% If you say \begin{abstract}[Keywords:] instead of the simple \begin{abstract}, a list of the keywords is appended.
% The list comes from the \keywords command above.

\tableofcontents
\listoftables                      % Pittetd will complain if you tell it to create a list of tables when there are no
%                                   tables (as in this sample file). Uncomment this command if you have tables.
\listoffigures                     % Obvious analogous for figures.
%\preface
% This is the text of the preface, with acknowledgments, dedication, etc. It is optional, and you create, as shown, by 
% just saying \preface and starting the preface's actual text. Note that 'foreword' is no longer acceptable as title
% for this preliminary.

%Conventions, such as notation (nomenclature) and abbreviations, don't receive their own preliminary page. They can be included as an appendix, or as part of the introduction.
