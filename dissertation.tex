\begin{abstract}
Understanding a patientâ€™s neurodevelopmental status is valuable for many research and clinical applications. Neurodevelopmental evaluations can be performed through psychological testing or individual assessments with a psychologist. However, these approaches are not applicable in all cases. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRIs) can be used to study neuronal networks that are active when the patient is in a task-free state. These image sequences are highly sensitive to motion. Techniques have been developed to prevent patients from moving, monitor motion during the scan, and correct motion after the scan. We focus on the first step of retrospective motion correction: volume registration.

The purpose of volume registration is to align the contents of all of the image volumes in the image sequence to those of a single volume. Traditionally, all image volumes are directly registered to the chosen stationary image volume, but this approach does not account for significant differences in patient position across the sequence. We developed a registration framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). We treat the volumes in the sequence as nodes in a graph where pairs of subsequent volumes are connected via directed edges. This perspective better models the relationships between volumes and accounts for them during registration.

We applied both registration frameworks to a set of simulated images as well as neurological rs-fMRIs from three clinical populations of patients who are healthy or have congenital heart disease (CHD). The original and registered sequences were compared with respect to their local and global motion. These motion parameters were used to determine how many sequences had statistically significant differences in their motion distributions before and after registration. The metrics of the original sequences were clustered to identify age group-specific motion patterns.

The registration frameworks had different effects on each age group. We found that the neonatal subjects contained the least amount of motion, while the fetal subjects contained the most motion. The DAG-based registration was most effective at reducing motion in the fetal images. Our clustering analysis showed that the different age groups have different global motion parameters, though patterns related to CHD status could not be detected.

\section{Acknowledgements}

This project would not have been possible without the assistance and support of many people. First, to my committee members: Dr. Doug Landsittal, Dr. Ashok Panigrahy, Dr. Greg Cooper, and Dr. Rafael Ceschin. Your guidance and suggestions were truly invaluable. Second, to the members of PIRC, especially: Julia Wallace, Vince Lee, and Nancy Beluk, for helping wrangle the data and answering questions about behavioral techniques used during pediatric scans; Dr. Vincent Schmithorst, for the many conversations about the intricacies of MR physics; Billy Reynolds, for the fetal data and for pulling the occasional perfect figure seemingly out of thin air; and Samuel Cho, for helping me develop the data simulation and aptly naming it ``SPECTr''. Third, this document would not be the same without the Writing Accountability Groups organized and run by Dr. Moriah Kirdy through the Pitt Writing Center. Moriah's dedication and organization is (thankfully) contagious. 

A successful dissertation is only partly made up of the research and writing. The rest is managing people, places, and paperwork. Many thanks to Toni Porterfield and Tami Robinson for helping me keep my administrative ducks in a row and to Barbara Karnbauer for helping coordinate schedules. 

Of course, I would like to thank my friends and family. Ryan, for keeping me grounded, and for rock climbing, burritos, and ice cream. My friends in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, for the laughs, game sessions, and more rock climbing. Mom and Dad, thanks for supporting me the way you always do. Jonathan and David, I'm over the moon you were able to make my defense. 

Finally, special thanks to everyone involved with Extra Life, a charity that raises money for kids being helped by Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As promised, here is the shout out to those who donated to my page, especially to Leo Chan, Elliot Guiso, Bonnie Young, John Maloney, Justine White, and Mike West.
