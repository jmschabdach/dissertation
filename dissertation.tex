\begin{abstract}
Approximately 1.35 million children are diagnoses with a congenital heart defect (CHD) annually. As the process of diagnosing and treating CHD has improved, the expected lifespan of CHD patients has increased: at least 12 to 34 million adults worldwide have CHD. A larger population living with CHD means that clinicials are learning more about conditions which CHD patients are at increased risk of getting. Some of these conditions affect the patient's neurodevelopment and neurocognitive status. Diagnosis of the neurocognitive conditions is performed using surveys, but examining the structure and function of the brain could offer more objective diagnoses. 

One tool useful for examining a patient's brain is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in particular can be used to reveal information about the neuronal networks in the patient's brain. Unfortunately, rs-fMRIs are highly susceptible to motion. Clinical and behavioral techniques can help patients move less during a rs-fMRI scan, though they do not guarantee motion-free images. Various sensors can be used to monitor and correct for motion during the scan, but these sensors are useless when it comes to recovering previously acquired rs-fMRIs corrupted by motion.

We devised a novel approach to volume registration, which is the first step in motion correction. We compare it to traditional volume registration in the context of a complete motion correction pipeline. The registration techniques and pipeline were applied to neurological rs-fMRIs of fetal, neonatal, preadolescent, and adult patients with CHD as well as several phantom images. We identified different motion patterns specific to different demographic groups, and discovered relationships between certain motion patterns and clinical outcomes associated with CHD and different neurodevelopmental conditions.

\section{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

This project would not have been possible without the assistance and support of many people. First, to my committee members: Dr. Doug Landsittal, Dr. Ashok Panigrahy, Dr. Greg Cooper, and Dr. Rafael Ceschin. Your guidance and suggestions were truly invaluable. Second, to the members of PIRC, especially: Julia Wallace, Vince Lee, and Nancy Beluk, for helping wrangle the data and answering questions about behavioral techniques used during pediatric scans; Dr. Vincent Schmithorst, for the many conversations about the intricacies of MR physics; Billy Reynolds, for the fetal data and for pulling the occasional perfect figure seemingly out of thin air; and Samuel Cho, for helping me develop the data simulation and aptly naming it ``SPECTr''. Third, this document would not be the same without the Writing Accountability Groups organized and run by Dr. Moriah Kirdy through the Pitt Writing Center. Moriah's dedication and organization is (thankfully) contagious. 

A successful dissertation is only partly made up of the research and writing. The rest is managing people, places, and paperwork. Many thanks to Toni Porterfield and Tami Robinson for helping me keep my administrative ducks in a row and to Barbara Karnbauer for helping coordinate schedules. 

Of course, I would like to thank my friends and family. Ryan, for keeping me grounded, and for rock climbing, burritos, and ice cream. My friends in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, for the laughs, game sessions, and more rock climbing. Mom and Dad, thanks for supporting me the way you always do. Jonathan and David, I'm over the moon you were able to make my defense. 

Finally, special thanks to everyone involved with Extra Life, a charity that raises money for kids being helped by Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As promised, here is the shout out to those who donated to my page, especially to Leo Chan, Elliot Guiso, Bonnie Young, John Maloney, Justine White, and Mike West.
